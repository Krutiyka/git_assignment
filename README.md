# Git Assignment - Krutiyka

a. What is an issue?
GitHub Issues are items you can create in a repository to plan,discuss and track work.
 Issues are simple to create and flexible to suit a variety of scenarios.
 You can use issues to track work, give or receive feedback, collaborate on ideas or tasks,
 and efficiently communicate with others.

b. What is a pull request?
A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another.
Pull requests are essential for facilitating code reviews, encouraging collaboration,
 and maintaining a clean, well-documented codebase.

c. How do I open up a pull request?
After you have committed your changes to GitHub, you should see a prompt alerting you
 that your branch is a number of “commits” ahead of the repository you forked it from.
Click the Contribute dropdown. Clicking this button will prompt you to open a pull request.
 Then, click the Open pull request button.

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.
1. In GitHub, navigate to the repository page and click Settings in the right hand corner.
2. In the sidebar, you’ll see an Access section with a Collaborators & teams option.
 Click through and you’ll see an Add people button to the right of Manage Access.
3. You can add a collaborator using either their username, full name, or email address.
4. Once you specify who you are inviting, you can select their level of permissions.
Once the invite is sent, the recipient receives a notification. At this point,
 the recipient can accept or decline the invite via email or the GitHub platform.
If you run into issues, it might be because of a policy for your Enterprise that restricts
 who can invite outside contributors.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?
The key difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is a free, open source version
 control tool that developers install locally on their personal computers,
 while GitHub is a pay-for-use online service built to run Git in the cloud.
 Git is a piece of software. GitHub is an online SaaS service.

f. What does git diff do?
git diff is a multi-use Git command that when executed runs a diff function
 on Git data sources. These data sources can be commits, branches, files and more.

g. What is the main branch?
The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits,
 you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push
 our changes directly into the main branch?
It's generally not recommended to push changes directly to the main branch,
 especially in collaborative projects. Instead, it's best practice to work on separate
branches, make your changes, test them, and then merge them into the main branch via
a pull request or merge request after review. This helps maintain a clean and stable main
branch and allows for collaboration and code review before changes are integrated.
